Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures.
• Designing a CMOR model to cognize and generalize geo-simulation experiments’ (GSE) operation cycle which demonstrates different stages
• Designing reference descriptions to serve as guidelines for reproducible GSEs
• Designing reproduction documents to record the computational processes of GSEs
• Designing a benchmark for assessing the computational reproducibility of GSEs
• Designing a statistical model for evaluating the reproducibility probability of GSEs in GeoScience
• Implementing mechanism of workflow for tracing the researchers’ actions in GSEs
• Designing a unified computing environment for online reproduction using Docker
• Designing an Geographic automated configuration tool for computational environment for geo-analysis model - using python and R languages as examples
• Designing a LLM-based DocumentBot to automatically generate visual reproduction documents with expert knowledge
